## Update 1 (23/04/2020)

After struggling with a theme to base my quiz app around I changed to a more educational approach than a game show trivia one.  The Menu has been changed, settings is no longer accessable from the title screen.  Settings are set individually for the quiz inside the quiz menu.  Questions are structured around:

NSW Syllabuses (mostly stage 3):

Bloom's Taxonomy:
eductional psychology for learning and teaching - 4th edition, pages 218 - 221

Singleplayer has been changed to an in built quiz.  Question are no longer drawn from a hash and randomised but are hard coded.  Rather than having a short quiz with a score at the end, there are rounds, each round is loosely based around 2 different types of learning.

## Update 2 (24/04/2020)

Scoring now changed to fit rounds better.  Each round requires a passing grade to move to the next round.  Timer added to race user to the end of the quiz. the timer no longer ejects the user from the quiz but instead grants bonus points if the user beats it (depending on timer selected).  Scorescreen that is made available at the end of the quiz now only allows users to save scores if they pass all the checks for both the timer and pass/fail grades for each round.
